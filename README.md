# Lending-club-loan-data-analysis
Deciding the interest rate for a loan is critical for Fintech companies. If interest rate is too high, people won't borrow from you, you'll lose revenue. If interest is too low, you also will earn less.
Lending Club is a famous  peer-to-peer lending company. Through analyzing it's loan data sets, we can get several useful insights.
First, we can get to know the effect of different features even if we don't understand Fintech industry at all. 
Second, we can learn what is important when Lending Club make a decision. New companies can learn experience and make better decisions.
Third, we can build a predictive model to predict interest rate based on Lending Club's loan data, and use the results of this model as a benchmark for our own decisions. Based on this benchmark, New companies can improve their own models.
The result of my project is the most important features and their effects on deciding interest rate, and a good predictive model to predict interest rate.
The goal of my project is to use the Result of lending Club to improve our ability.
